# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to *The R Workshop Book*! 

This book was originally designed as a companion to two R workshops that I developed and taught at the University of Utah: "Introduction to R for Data Analysis", which I teach over 2 days, and "Advanced R for Data Analysis", which is just a 1 day workshop. So far, I've only released the book content for the first workshop, but keep an eye on this space as I'll be progressively releasing the advanced workshop chapters.

This book, like the original workshops on which it is based, is designed to get you up and running with using R for the analysis of tabular data (i.e., data that comes in a table) using the tidyverse, focusing on data manipulation and data visualization.


My approach is a somewhat less fancy approach to teaching R than many of the existing modern R books out there, such as [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/), which starts working working with data and creating visualizations up front. These are great books, but I personally prefer to teach beginners in a more linear fashion, which takes a more linear step-by-step approach, starting with understanding how the programming language works and building up to fancy things like actually working with data. If you're looking to be inspired, *R for Data Science* is probably a better book for you. But if you're looking for a resource to give you the building blocks for learning R, starting with the absolute basics, then you're in the right place.

The R programming language is constantly evolving, and my goal is to keep this book up-to-date as new developments emerge.


## Teaching from this book

You are absolutely welcome to teach from this book however you like, but I do request that you provide appropriate attribution.


## Inspiration attribution


Original inspiration for the first parts of this book came from Software Carpentry, which is where I first encountered the gapminder dataset that is used throughout (however, the materials you will find in this book bear little-to-no resemblance to any of the R Software Carpentry workshops.)
